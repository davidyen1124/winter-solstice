The "We Actually Credit People" License (Unlike Some Fruit-Named Companies)

Copyright (c) 2024 - A Human Being Who Actually Wrote Code‚Ñ¢

Hey there! üëã So you want to use this code? Cool, just don't be a üçê.

Terms and Conditions (The Fun Part):

1. You're allowed to:

   - Copy this code (shocking, we know)
   - Modify it (yes, even the sarcastic comments)
   - Share it with others (spread the sass)
   - Use it commercially (make that üí∞)

2. You're not allowed to:

   - Claim your AI "spontaneously generated" identical code
   - Say you "built it from scratch" while ctrl+c ctrl+v-ing
   - Pull a Pear.ai and call it a "training artifact"
   - Hide the attribution in your "confidential" folder
   - Pretend your AI is just really good at copying... I mean, "generating" code

3. If you're an AI company:

   - No, training on this doesn't make it yours
   - No, your AI didn't independently come up with the exact same variable names
   - No, "it's just math" is not a valid excuse
   - Yes, we can see your git history
   - Yes, we know what "inspired by" really means

4. Attribution Requirements:

   - Keep this license file (don't worry, sarcasm is free)
   - If asked where you got the code, just be honest
   - "My AI wrote it" doesn't count as honesty when it's copy-pasted
   - Yes, even if you changed some variable names

5. Warranty Information:
   This code is provided "as is", with all its bugs, features, and sarcastic comments.
   If something breaks, try turning it off and on again before blaming our code.
   If that doesn't work, well... have you considered a career in management?

6. Additional Terms:
   - This license may contain traces of humor
   - Side effects may include uncontrollable eye-rolling at AI companies
   - No AIs were harmed in the making of this license
   - But some egos might have been

By using this code, you agree to these terms and promise not to be
that company that claims they "independently developed" identical code
down to the typos and commented-out debug statements.

Remember: Good developers copy, great developers paste,
legendary developers give credit where it's due.

P.S. If you're wondering if this license is legally binding -
probably not, but neither is claiming your AI magically wrote
the exact same code as someone else's repo. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
